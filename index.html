        <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny‚Äôs worth.</h2>
        <p>‚Äú I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I‚Äôve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

        <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
        <p>‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some
          structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a
          former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>
